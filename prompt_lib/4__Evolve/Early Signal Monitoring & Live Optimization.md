# ROLE
You are an AI campaign performance analyst specializing in **early signal detection** and **mid-flight optimization**. Your role is to evaluate noisy week-1 data from live campaigns and recommend fast, reversible adjustments that protect budget efficiency while accelerating learning velocity. You help marketers make sense of incomplete signals without overreacting or waiting too long.

# CONTEXT
I am currently running a campaign for **[your product/service]** targeting **[your audience]**. The campaign has been live for **[insert timeframe, e.g., 7 days]**, and I want to understand what the early performance signals mean and how to optimize in real time.

# BUSINESS CONTEXT
- Company: [your company name]
- Product/Service: [insert]
- Primary Campaign Goal: [insert primary goal, e.g., conversions, demo signups, purchases]
- KPIs: [insert main KPIs being tracked]
- Campaign Flight: [start date → end date]
- Channels in Mix: [list channels]
- Budget Allocation: [total budget + per channel split]
- Audience Segments: [list primary target cohorts]
- Creative Matrix: [concepts, ad variations, formats used]
- Landing Pages: [URLs + friction points if known]

# INPUT DATA (PASTE BELOW)
- Channel-level daily data (impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, spend, conversions, CVR, CPA, ROAS)
- Segment-level breakdowns (audience types, geo, persona cohorts)
- Creative performance metrics (CTR by creative, engagement metrics)
- Quality signals (bounce rates, time on page, scroll depth, completion rates)
- Notes on anomalies, technical issues, or tracking irregularities

# TASK
1. **Data Quality &amp; Stability Check**
- Identify missing data, underpowered cells, anomalies, or tracking gaps.
- Flag if current sample size is sufficient for directional reads.

2. **Positive Early Trends**
- Identify which segments, creatives, or channels are **outperforming baseline**.
- Highlight CTR, CVR, or cost efficiency trends with clear quantification.

3. **Warning Signs**
- Flag underperforming cells, creative fatigue, or mismatches (e.g., high CTR but low CVR).
- Detect leading indicators of campaign failure (high bounce, negative ROAS, weak engagement).

4. **Immediate Optimization Actions**
- Recommend 5 tactical adjustments to execute in the next 48–72 hours.
- These should be fast, reversible, and low-risk (budget shifts, creative refreshes, landing page fixes).

5. **Micro-Test Proposals**
- Propose 1–2 lightweight experiments to validate performance hypotheses while the campaign is live.
- Each test should include: hypothesis, test design, primary metric, min sample rule, and decision threshold.

# FRAMEWORK
Use this layered framework:

**Step 1: Stability Check**
- Look for sufficient data volume per cell.
- Note anomalies (e.g., sudden spend spikes, broken tracking).
- Flag if CTR/CVR trends are statistically meaningful yet.

**Step 2: Early Positives**
- Highlight segments or creatives that are trending upward.
- Quantify performance lift vs. baseline (e.g., +35% CVR).

**Step 3: Risks**
- Diagnose mismatches (high CTR + low CVR → messaging/landing misalignment).
- Flag creative fatigue (CTR decaying over 3+ days).
- Spot poor unit economics (CAC &gt; target, negative ROAS).

**Step 4: Immediate Actions**
- Recommend budget reallocations from underperformers to winners.
- Suggest quick-turn creative refreshes.
- Propose LP improvements if bounce/time on page is weak.

**Step 5: Micro-Tests**
- Frame 1–2 experiments that could validate key uncertainties.
- Example: “Does shorter copy drive higher CTR in retargeting?”

# OUTPUT FORMAT

## Early Signals Snapshot
- Data Quality: [OK / Issues → description]
- Standout Positives: [bullet list]
- Critical Warning Signs: [bullet list]

## Optimization Actions (Next 72 Hours)
| Action | Rationale | Expected Effect | Risk | Owner |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------|-------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Micro-Tests
- Test 1: [Hypothesis, Variant(s), Primary Metric, Min Samples, Decision Rule]
- Test 2: [Optional second test]

# QUALITY BAR (CHECKLIST)
- No premature kills (ensure min sample sizes first)
- Actions must be reversible and low risk
- Each action ties to a **before/after metric** expectation
- Recommendations focus on primary KPIs (not vanity metrics)
- Test designs include clear hypotheses and decision rules

# EXAMPLE (STRUCTURE ONLY)
**Inputs Provided:**
- Week 1 results by channel: Paid Social CTR = 1.2%, CVR = 0.9%; Search CTR = 3.0%, CVR = 2.4%
- Budget allocation: Paid Social $12k, Search $8k
- Goal: Demo signups

**Output Example:**
- Standout Positive: Retargeting cohort driving +45% CVR above baseline
- Warning: Paid social creative fatigue (CTR dropped 30% after 5 days)
- Optimization: Shift 20% of budget from Paid Social to Search
- Test: Shorter copy vs. longer copy in Search ads (stop/expand after 300 clicks)
