### 2. Tailor (`prompt_lib/2__Tailor/`)
Personalization and targeting prompts including:

## File Structure

- `prompt_lib/index.md` - Master index of all prompts organized by framework stage
- `prompt_lib/[1-4]__[Stage]/[Prompt Name].md` - Individual prompt files
- Each prompt file contains structured templates with:
  - ROLE definition
  - CONTEXT explanation
  - TASK description
  - Business context variables
  - Implementation frameworks

## Common Development Tasks

Since this is a documentation/prompt repository, common tasks involve:

- Adding new prompts to the appropriate framework stage directory
- Updating the `prompt_lib/index.md` file when adding new prompts
- Following the established naming convention: `[Number]__[Stage]/[Descriptive Name].md`
- Maintaining consistent prompt structure with ROLE, CONTEXT, TASK, and business context sections

## Prompt Structure Standards

All prompts follow a consistent structure:
- **ROLE**: Defines the AI assistant's role and expertise
- **CONTEXT**: Explains the business situation
- **TASK**: Specific task to accomplish
- **Business Context**: Variables for customization
- Implementation sections with specific frameworks and methodologies

This repository serves as a comprehensive marketing strategy prompt library following HubSpot's Loop Marketing methodology.
